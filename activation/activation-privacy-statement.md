# Activation Privacy Statement

SysKit asks you to activate your copy of SPDocKit so that we may verify your product was purchased legally. The Activation is based on a couple of values retrieved during the activation process, which help identify your computer. These values are used to uniquely identify the computer - they **do not include** any information about the software or data on your computer, or information about the computer model or environment.
