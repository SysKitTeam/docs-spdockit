# License Management

The License Management dialog allows you to enter the number of SharePoint Standard and Enterprise licenses \(CALs\) you have purchased. Data provided will be used to generate license compliance and [feature usage reports](../explore-reports-and-create-documentation/analytics-and-usage-reports/analytics-and-usage-reports-screen.md). This feature also allows you to define and track custom features licensing and usage.
