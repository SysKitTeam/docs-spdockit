# Activate SPDocKit

## Online Activation

### Farm license

The Farm license is tied to a **farm ID** and can be activated only on servers with SharePoint installed. This also means that you can activate a single Farm license on all servers in one SharePoint farm.

1. From the left navigation bar on the **Backstage Screen** select **Help** and click on the **License Details** section to begin the activation process.
2. Fill in the **Name**, **Email**, **Company**, and **Product Key** fields.

   The product key is a combination of letters and numbers. In order to claim your activation key, please log in to our [customers portal](https://my.syskit.com). There you will be able to track your orders and download the latest application versions you are entitled to. When a major upgrade becomes available, all customers with a valid software assurance will have their profile refreshed with new version download link and a brand new activation key.

   Once you have entered the product key it will be validated against our activation server. If your key is valid, a green check mark will appear next to it.

3. Click the **Activate** button to start the activation process. Activation takes a couple of seconds and is a one time process.

### Workstation license

The Workstation license is tied to the **workstation ID** and cannot be used on a SharePoint server. It is intended for people who would like to explore SPDocKit reports, manage permissions directly from their computers or do not have the direct access to SharePoint servers.

1. From the left navigation bar on the **Backstage Screen** select **Help** and click on the **License Details** section to begin the activation process.
2. Fill in the **Name**, **Email**, **Company**, and **Product Key** fields.
