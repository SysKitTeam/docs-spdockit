# Manage License

The SPDocKit license key is available at your profile in our [Customers Portal](https://my.syskit.com). In order to check your current license status in SPDocKit, navigate to **File &gt; Help &gt; License Details**. You can see if SPDocKit is activated or not, which license edition you are currently using, how many days is the license valid for and the farm ID.

## Change current license key

To remove your current farm license and add a new license key, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **File &gt; Help &gt; License Details**.
2. Click on the field below the License Details title.
3. Click on the option **Deactivate** license and click Yes. 
4. Enter the new product key and click **Activate**.

## Deactivate license

To deactivate your current license, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to File &gt; Help. 
2. Click on the field below the **License Details** title.
3. Click on the **Deactivate License** link. 
4. Confirm you would like to deactivate the license.

SPDocKit license is now deactivated and you can use it again.

If you experience any problems reactivating the license, [contact our support team](https://www.syskit.com/company/contact-us/) to help you troubleshoot the issue. Please provide the **farm ID** of the SharePoint farm currently activated with the key you would like to reactivate.
