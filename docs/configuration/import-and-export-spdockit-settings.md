# Import and Export SPDocKit Settings

If you need to set up SPDocKit options on multiple farms, this feature can help you copy your application settings from one SPDocKit instance to another in order to preserve your preferences.

1. Navigate to the **Backstage Help Screen** and click **Application Settings Management**.
2. To export your settings, select the Export Settings option, then choose the location you wish to export and save your settings to. SPDocKit will create a settings.SPDAppSettings file. You can transfer it to any other server where you have SPDocKit installed.

To import certain settings to other SPDocKit installations, select **Import Settings**, then choose the location from which you wish to import. Click **OK** to proceed.

## Available options

Importing and exporting application settings affects the report and export options, data collection interval, database index reorganization, snapshot load setup, data retention policy and options, customer improvement participation selection, email settings, and Best Practices report settings.

You can choose which of these settings will be exported to a **settings.SPDAppSettings** file.
