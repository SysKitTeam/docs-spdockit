# Configure SPDocKit

## SharePoint Server

This section explains how to configure SPDocKit database and service before the first usage, while installed on a SharePoint server.

**SPDocKit Configuration wizard** will automatically start when you start SPDocKit for the first time. Follow these steps to successfully configure the application:

1. On the **Database** wizard page select whether to create a new database or use an existing one. [Read more](configure-spdockit-database.md) about the SPDocKit database.
2. On the **Database Configuration** wizard page specify the **SQL Server, Database Name** and authentication. It is possible to overwrite the existing database under the same name.
   * If you are using the default instance type  "servername", or "servername.yourdomain.loc"
   * If you are using a named instance type "servername\instancename", or "servername.yourdomain.loc\instancename"
   * If your SQL Server is on a non-standard port \(different from 1433\), type "severname,port" or "servername\instance,port". \(FQDN formats are also supported\)

     After providing the information, click the **Test Connection** button to ensure that the settings are correct.
3. On the **Service Configuration** wizard page check **Enable Service** and type the service account details. The service account needs to have the [following privileges](../requirements/user-permissions-requirements.md) to be able to run the service, create snapshots and other associated jobs.

   If you do not want to use the SPDocKit Service you can leave the **Enable Service** unchecked, but the following features will not be available:

   * Automatic Snapshots
   * Automatic Data Retention
   * Automatic Subscriptions and Alerts
   * Index Reorganization
   * Automatic Rules and Queries

4. click **Next** to complete the Configuration Wizard and apply the changes.

**Please note!**  
To configure your SPDocKit settings more thoroughly, navigate to the **File** tab, click on the **Configuration** in the left navigation bar and press [Options](../configure-and-extend-spdockit/backstage-screen.md) button.
{% endhint %}

## Workstation

This article explains how to configure SPDocKit on a workstation. A SPDocKit workstation instance allows you to manage SharePoint On-Premise, view SPDocKit reports, compare farm settings and track changes without having to connect to a SharePoint server.

**Requirements**: To view SPDocKit reports directly from your PC workstation, you must have the SPDocKit [Workstation license](https://www.syskit.com/products/spdockit/pricing/) and the user running the application on a workstation needs to have adequate [permissions](../requirements/user-permissions-requirements.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**  
To use SPDocKit reports on your workstation, you need to have SPDocKit installed on an actual SharePoint server to load the data. A workstation installation cannot create new farm snapshots or load information about permissions; it can only explore previously loaded data and manage permissions in real-time using Permissions Explorer.
{% endhint %}

To install and configure SPDocKit on a workstation, follow these instructions:

1. [Download](https://www.spdockit.com/downloads/) SPDocKit to your workstation. **The SPDocKitSetup.exe file is the same for both server and workstation installation**.
2. Follow the [Installation Guide](../installation/installation-guide.md) to install it on your workstation. Once you have successfully installed the tool, the Configuration Wizard will open.
3. Enter the database server and database name from which you would like to retrieve the data. If you wish to monitor multiple farms from your workstation, all these SharePoint farms must be connected **to the same SPDocKit database**. Click **Next** to finish your configuration.
4. Click **Finish** to start using SPDocKit on your workstation.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please Note!**  
When using SPDocKit on your workstation, the **SPDocKit Service will not be available**.
{% endhint %}

The following features are available:

* Snapshots \(Farm Explorer and Best Practices reports\)
* All reports \(Site Explorer, Permissions Reports, Analytics & Usage Reports, and Audit Reports\) except Queries and Rules
* Live Permissions Explorer
* Permission management for SharePoint On-Premise
