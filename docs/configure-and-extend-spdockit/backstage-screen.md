# Backstage Screen

The Backstage Actions view is a set of commands that can be used to quickly approach major SPDocKit options.

The following options are available:

* **Take Snapshot** button loads SharePoint farm data if an on-premises farm is detected. This option is only available on SharePoint servers.
* **View Snapshots** button will take you to all your saved snapshots, and you can select any of them to open and view data.
* **Compare Wizard** button starts the compare wizard that allows you to compare farms, Web applications, site collections, web config files, and permissions.
* **Options** button gives you access to configuration options for adjusting SPDocKit to your needs.
* **Permissions Explorer** leads you directly to SharePoint permissions, both live and historical records, collected by SPDocKit.
* **Permissions Wizards** button gives you quick access to all permissions management options available. 
* **Permissions Reports** button will show you a set of permissions reports. 
* **Analytics & Usage** button will take you to the Analytics & Usage Reports. The Site Collection Analytics report is preselected, where you can see popularity trends and hits history for each site collection.
* **Audit Logs** button will take you to the Audit Log Details report, where we'll show you a complete audit log on the selected site collections in a given time period.
* Use the **Queries and Rules** button to open and create desired procedures or reports to enforce your SharePoint Governance policies.

  Note that this option is not available on a workstation.
