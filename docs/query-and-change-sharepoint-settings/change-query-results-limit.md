# Change SPDocKit Query Results Limit

By default, query results are limited to 1,000 query results per site collection. However, if your query produces more than 1,000 results and you wish to see all of them, you can change this limit in the SPDocKit Options.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**  
Changing the limit to a higher number also means the time needed for SPDocKit to execute your query will be increased.
{% endhint %}

1. Navigate to the Backstage Configuration Screen and click **Options**.
2. Go to **General** options and edit the value in the **Maximum number of query results per site collection** field. Click Save to save your changes.
