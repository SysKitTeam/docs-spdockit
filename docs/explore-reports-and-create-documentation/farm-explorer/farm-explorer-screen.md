In version 7.2 we streamlined the selection of farms and snapshots by including those filters on the Farm Explorer and Best Practices tabs and persisting the selection across all tabs. This should remove the need to switch back and forth between the snapshots list and the other tabs in order to change the viewed snapshot data. We hope this results in a much more enjoyable experience for you.
