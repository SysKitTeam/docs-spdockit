# Change the Limit on Site Topology Report

This section describes how to change the limit on the Site Topology report in SPDocKit.

By default, the number of site collections shown in the Site Topology report is limited to ten site collections. However, if you have more than ten site collections and you wish to see all of them on the Site Topology report, you can change this limit in SPDocKit Options.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**  
Changing the limit to a higher number of site collections also means that it will take longer to generate the Site Topology report.
{% endhint %}

1. Navigate to the **Backstage Configuration Screen** and click **Options**.
2. Under **Report** options, you change the value limit. Enter the value in the **Maximum number of site collections to show in Site Topology report field**. Click **Save** to save and finish your customization.
