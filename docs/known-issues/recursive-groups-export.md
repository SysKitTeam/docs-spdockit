# Recursive groups issue with export

## **Summary**

The problem occurs when any of the Permission Explorer or Permissions Reports is containing recursive groups and is exported or generated with a subscription. The resulting document comes with a couple of errors when trying to display recursive group members - unnecessary whitespace is shown between columns, the height of some rows is increased and the group icons are displaced.

## **Solution**

Currently there is no workaround for this issue.

**Status:** Not resolved.
