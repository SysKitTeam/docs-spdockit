# My permissions loading status is reported as ”Failed”

## Problem

When I am trying to load my SharePoint farm permissions, loading wizard informs me that loading status is Failed for some of the objects.

## Solution

Make sure that the user account running SPDocKit has the proper [permission privileges](../../requirements/user-permissions-requirements.md) for the SharePoint farm for which you are trying to load the permissions.

Check the event log for the SPDocKit related entries and [contact us](https://www.syskit.com/company/contact-us/).
