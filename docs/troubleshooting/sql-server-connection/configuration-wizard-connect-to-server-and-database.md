# SPDocKit wonâ€™t connect to a provided server and database

## Problem

The SQL Server Browser service is not running. When this service is not running you cannot connect to named instances.

## Solution

The SQL Server Browser service needs to be up and running.

1. Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager** on your SQL server.
2. Click on SQL Server Services. Find the **SQL Server** Browser service, right-click on it and press **Start**.
3. Do not forget to [allow inbound traffic on TCP Port 1434](inbound-traffic.md).
