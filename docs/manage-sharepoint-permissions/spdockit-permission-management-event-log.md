# SPDocKit Permission Management Event Log

Each permission management management action, both using management buttons and wizards, is written and saved in SPDocPerm event log. It is located in Windows event log under **Applications and Services Logs**. Here you can see:

* details regarding the permission change â€“ which action and on which SharePoint object
* which user account made the change
* when was the change made
