Supported People Picker selection for the group owner are **SharePoint user** and **SharePoint group**. Just like in SharePoint, there are other group properties you can adjust using this wizard:
   * Who can view memberships of the group
   * Who can edit the membership of the group
   * Will the requests to join/leave this group be allowed
   * Will these request be auto-accepted
   * Send membership request to provided email requests
5. All of the newly created groups will have same permissions assigned to them where possible. If, for some reason, some permission levels are not available on a certain site collection, they will be skipped. If no permissions can be assigned to the new group on a site collection, that site collection will be skipped and no new groups will be created.
6. In this step, as Group Members you can add Users and AD groups. Plus, as a default member, you can add Owner of the group by simply checking the provided box.
7. These cases and more will be displayed in the **Preview** step of the wizard, before any action has been made. This step will list all the actions that will be taken in the next step of the wizard, which allows you to modify any settings you might like to.
8. The last step shows user the changes that were made. If some errors have occurred they will be displayed here. It is possible to save this log to disk as a .txt file using **Save Log** button.
