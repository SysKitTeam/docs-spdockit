# Site Collection Administrators Wizard

**Wizard Scope**: farm, web application, site collection

Supported People Picker principal selection for:

* **Primary Administrator**: SharePoint user
* **Secondary Administrator**: SharePoint user
* **Administrators Group**: SharePoint user, Active Directory group \(multiselect allowed\)

## Set Primary Administrator

This wizard option allows you to set a specified user as a primary administrator in place of the existing one across the selected wizard scope. People picker supports exactly one SharePoint user as a valid choice.

3. The **Target** step allows you to specify the entire farm, web application or just specific site collection\(s\) in which changes will be made.
4. Specify which user should be set as the primary administrator. Just like in SharePoint, exactly one primary administrator is allowed.
5. This step will list all the actions that will be taken in the next step of the wizard. Make sure that the pending changes will do exactly what you wanted and have specified in previous steps of this wizard. If the user is already set as the primary admin on any of selected site collections, wizard will inform you.
6. The last step shows user the changes that were made. If some errors have occurred they will be displayed here. It is possible to save this log to disk as a .txt file using **Save Log** button.

There will be information about changes that were made as well as who made those changes.
