# Add Tags

## **Tags**

In the Permissions Explorer, you can find another useful feature - adding tags to Securable Objects.

Tags can be added Live but also when exploring previously created snapshots.

To add a tag navigate to the top menu's **Tags** ribbon under the **Data** category. Select your target - Securable Object - in the **Permissions Explorer**, and select the **Add Tag** button. In the same ribbon, you can also find the **Delete Tag** button to remove a tag from the selected Object.

**Add Tag** and **Delete Tag** options are also available in the context menu which appears if you right-click a Securable Object in the tree view.

To view all created tags navigate to **Snapshots** section and select the **Tagged Objects** report. Information about all tagged objects is displayed in the **Object**, **Object Type** and **Object Url** columns which, by default, are grouped by **Tag**. The **Tagged Objects** report can also be accessed directly from the **Permissions Explorer** by selecting the **Go to Report** option in the top menu's **Tags** ribbon.

The **Tagged Objects** report can easily be exported by selecting the **Export** option from the **Home** ribbon in the top menu.

Each of the tagged objects can easily be accessed by selecting the appropriate row in the **Tagged Objects** report and clicking the **Go to Object** button in the top menu **Tags** ribbon.

Another upside of using the tag feature is the possibility to **search the Securable Objects by tags**. In the **Permissions Explorer** simply type the tag name into the **Search** text field. All Securable Objects tagged with the inputted text are displayed in a dropdown list. When you select a single object from the list, the object also becomes selected in the tree view and the permissions are displayed in the grid.
